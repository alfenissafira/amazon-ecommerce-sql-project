## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement  

The primary objective of this project is to analyze **Amazon Electronics Product Sales** (42K+ items, 17 features) in order to uncover trends, customer preferences, and product performance drivers.  

By leveraging **SQL**, this project explores how **discounts, ratings, reviews, Best Seller tags, sponsorships, coupons, BuyBox availability, delivery options, and sustainability tags** influence customer engagement and sales.  

This analysis aims to answer key **business questions** that can help sellers optimize **pricing, marketing, and inventory strategies** to maximize sales and customer satisfaction.
